## ðŸ§ª Clinical Trial Eligibility Matching Prototype
This repository features a prototype system for matching patients to clinical trials using Large Language Models (LLMs). An ETL pipeline to analyse and transform trial data and a prototype for API data endpoints are also included.

## Repository Structure
- _data/_ : Contains datasets and results.
  - Saved eligibility results (`Results_eligibility.json`)
- _notebooks/_ : Prototyping and analysis in Google Colab/Jupyter.
  - `analyse_trials.ipynb` â†’ trial data exploration and cleaning
  - `TrialSearch_prototype.ipynb` â†’ main pipeline for patientâ€“trial matching
  - `api.ipynb` â†’ prototype FastAPI service tested in Colab
- _pyfiles/_ : Python exports of the notebooks (cleaner scripts for reference).
- _src/_ : Utility modules (with helper functions) used by notebooks and API.
  - `analyse_utils.py` â†’ functions for parsing and analysing trial data
  - `api_utils.py` â†’ helpers for FastAPI endpoints
  - `trialsearch_utils.py` â†’ functions for building prompts, calling LLMs
